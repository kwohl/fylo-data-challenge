# Frontend Mentor - Fylo Data Storage Component

![Design preview for the Fylo data storage component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## The Challenge

The challenge was to build out a data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My personal goal was to practice the following:

- The CSS 'position' property
- Responsive design with media queries
- CSS selectors

Users can:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


## View Site

The desktop and mobile design mockups provided were created with the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px

The site can be viewed [here](https://fylo-data-challenge-one.vercel.app/)
